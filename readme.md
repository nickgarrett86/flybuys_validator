# Fly Buys Card Validator
This command line application validates Fly Buys card numbers.

## Getting Started
Ruby version 2.6.3 should be installed on the system. In order to run automated tests, RSpec should be installed.

## Running
To run the application, call ./bin/run.rb from the root directory of the project. Ensure that the file has execution permissions. Enter the card numbers you want validated (each on a new line) and finalise te input with a EOF character (ctrl-d on unix, ctrl-z on windows).
